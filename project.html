            <h2> Missial Man Of India </h2>
            <p> <b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam,</b> renowned for his significant contributions to India’s defense and space sectors, earned the moniker “Missile Man of India” due to his visionary leadership and scientific prowess. Dr Kalam persevered, worked hard, and was insatiably curious. In the Tamil Nadu state of Rameswaram, he was born.

                His essential contribution to India’s missile program is his career high point. He inspired the Agni and Prithvi missiles, strengthening India’s defense and international standing.
                
                However, “Missile Man of India” Dr. Kalam’s numerous accomplishments went far beyond missiles. He made a significant contribution to ISRO and space research.
                
                He started working as a scientist for the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). After that, he joined ISRO to work on SLV-III, India’s first satellite launch vehicle. He led India’s Rohini satellite launch, a significant achievement.</p>
